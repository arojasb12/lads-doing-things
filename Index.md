# HELLO LADS 

ITS LAD TIME 

The lads had a day planned that no one could predict and everyone would regret. First, Dan brought a unicycle he swore he could ride but promptly used it to knock over a fruit stand "for the aesthetic." Meanwhile, Kev decided the town fountain needed a ceremonial offering and gently lowered his shoe into the water like he was christening a ship. Then there was Mick, who accidentally started a conga line with a flock of geese, while shouting, "It's migration season, boys!" By the end of it, they were banned from three pubs, an arcade, and somehow a knitting circle they hadn't even entered. Classic Tuesday.
